# Verify Feature - Testing & Quality Assurance

**Phase:** 6 (Testing)

**Purpose:** Verify the implementation works correctly through comprehensive testing.

---

## Instructions for Claude

You are verifying the feature implementation. Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Run Existing Tests (Regression Check)

**CRITICAL:** Ensure no existing functionality broke.

```bash
pytest
```

**Expected:** All existing tests pass (no regressions)

**If tests fail:**
- Identify which tests failed
- Understand why they failed
- Determine if:
  - Test needs updating (behavior changed intentionally)
  - Code has bug (implementation error)
  - Test was already broken (pre-existing issue)
- Fix failures before proceeding

**Report to user:**
```
Test Results:
- Total: X tests
- Passed: Y tests
- Failed: Z tests
- Regressions: [list any tests that previously passed but now fail]
```

---

### Step 2: Verify New Tests Pass

**Run tests for new functionality:**

```bash
# Run service tests
pytest tests/test_*_service.py -v

# Run route tests
pytest tests/test_*_routes.py -v

# Run specific new tests
pytest tests/test_new_feature.py -v
```

**Expected:** All new tests pass

**If new tests fail:**
- Debug the implementation
- Fix bugs
- Re-run tests
- Don't proceed until all pass

---

### Step 3: Browser Smoke Test (MANDATORY for UI changes)

**Skip condition:** ONLY skip if feature has ZERO UI changes (pure backend/tests/docs).

**Prerequisites:**
- Local dev running: `./scripts/dev.sh`
- Browser open at http://localhost:8000
- Logged in with test account (admin@battle-d.com)

**3.1 Feature Page Loads:**
- [ ] Navigate to the feature's primary page
- [ ] Verify page renders without errors
- [ ] Check: No 404, no 500, content displays correctly

**3.2 Primary Action Works:**
- [ ] Perform the main action (click button, submit form, etc.)
- [ ] Verify expected result occurs
- [ ] Check: Success message shows, data saved, redirect works

**3.3 Console Check:**
- [ ] Open browser DevTools (F12) > Console tab
- [ ] Verify: No red errors
- [ ] Note any warnings (optional to fix)

**3.4 Navigation Links (if templates modified):**
- [ ] Click all navigation links on the page
- [ ] Verify: No 404 errors
- [ ] Check: All links lead to correct pages

**Document in test-results.md:**
```markdown
## Browser Smoke Test

**Tested on:** localhost:8000
**Account used:** admin@battle-d.com

**Results:**
| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Feature page loads | ✅ | Renders correctly |
| Primary action works | ✅ | Form submits, success message shows |
| Console errors | ✅ | No errors |
| Navigation links | ✅ | All sidebar links work |

**Issues found:** None / [describe if any]
```

### Step 4: Accessibility Testing (If UI Changes) (Methodology §6.3)

**ONLY if feature has UI changes. Skip if backend-only.**

**4.1 Keyboard Navigation**

Test with keyboard only (no mouse):
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements
- [ ] Tab order is logical (follows visual order)
- [ ] Enter/Space activates buttons/links
- [ ] Escape closes modals/dialogs

- [ ] aria-invalid on fields with validation errors
- [ ] role="alert" on error messages
- [ ] aria-current on current page nav link
- [ ] aria-live on dynamic content updates

**Check with browser DevTools** → Accessibility tab

**4.4 Color Contrast**

Verify color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA:
- [ ] Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1
- [ ] UI component contrast ≥ 3:1
- [ ] Links distinguishable from text (not by color alone)

**Check with browser DevTools** → Accessibility → Contrast

**Document issues:**
```markdown
### Color Contrast: ⚠️ Issues Found
- [x] Body text meets 4.5:1 (passes)
- [ ] Issue: Orange badge only 3.2:1 (needs darker shade)
- [x] Button contrast meets 3:1
```

**4.5 Focus Indicators**

Verify focus visible:
- [ ] Focus ring visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Focus not removed with CSS (outline: none without replacement)
- [ ] Focus ring high contrast
- [ ] Focus order matches visual order

---

### Step 5: Responsive Testing (If UI Changes) (Methodology §6.4)

**ONLY if feature has UI changes. Skip if backend-only.**

**Test on different viewport sizes:**

**5.1 Mobile (320px-768px)**

Use Chrome DevTools → Responsive Design Mode → 375px width

- [ ] Content stacks vertically
- [ ] Buttons full-width or properly sized
- [ ] Text readable (min 16px)
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 44x44px
- [ ] Sidebar collapses or becomes top nav
- [ ] Tables scroll horizontally or transform
- [ ] Images scale appropriately
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

**Document issues:**
```markdown
### Mobile (375px): ⚠️ Issues Found
- [x] Content stacks correctly
- [ ] Issue: Touch target for filter chips only 40px (needs 44px)
- [x] Text readable
- [x] No horizontal scroll
```

**5.2 Tablet (769px-1024px)**

Use Chrome DevTools → 768px width

- [ ] 2-column layouts work
- [ ] Sidebar visible or easily accessible
- [ ] Forms use optimal width (max 600px)
- [ ] Images and media scale correctly
- [ ] Touch targets adequate

**5.3 Desktop (1025px+)**

Use Chrome DevTools → 1440px width

- [ ] Multi-column layouts work
- [ ] Sidebar navigation visible
- [ ] Content doesn't stretch too wide (max-width used)
- [ ] Proper use of whitespace
- [ ] Images don't pixelate

**Document results:**
```markdown
### Responsive Testing: ✅ Pass

### Step 6: HTMX Interaction Testing (If Using HTMX) (Methodology §6.6)

**ONLY if feature uses HTMX. Skip if not applicable.**

**6.1 Verify HTMX Patterns Work**

**Live search/filtering:**
- [ ] Debounce working (no request on every keystroke)
- [ ] Results update correctly
- [ ] hx-target updates correct element
- [ ] Loading indicator shows (if implemented)

**Form submission:**
- [ ] Partial update works (only target element changes)
- [ ] Error state handled (form stays visible with errors)
- [ ] Success state handled (flash message or redirect)
- [ ] Form data preserved on error

**Polling/auto-refresh:**
- [ ] Updates happen at correct interval
- [ ] No memory leaks (check browser DevTools → Memory)
- [ ] Stops when page not visible (if configured)

**URL state preservation:**
- [ ] URL updates with hx-push-url
- [ ] Browser back button works
- [ ] Shareable URLs work (can paste URL to get same state)

**6.2 Check Network Requests**

Open browser DevTools → Network tab:
- [ ] Correct endpoints called
- [ ] Request headers include HX-Request: true
- [ ] Response is partial HTML (not full page)
- [ ] No unnecessary requests (debouncing works)

**Document results:**
```markdown
### HTMX Testing: ✅ Pass
- [x] Live filtering debounces correctly (500ms)
- [x] Partial updates work (only #battle-list changes)
- [x] URL state preserved with hx-push-url
- [x] Network requests efficient (no duplicates)
```

---

### Step 7: Coverage Check (Methodology §6.7)

**Run coverage report:**

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term
```

**Review coverage:**
- Overall coverage: X%
- New code coverage: Y%

**Coverage targets:**
- Overall: ≥ 90%
- Critical paths: 100% (authentication, validation, data integrity)
- New feature code: ≥ 95%

**Review uncovered lines:**
- Are they error handling that's hard to trigger?
- Are they truly unreachable code?
- Should we add tests to cover critical paths?

**Document results:**
```markdown
### Coverage Report:
- Overall: 92% (target ≥90%) ✅
- New feature code: 96% (target ≥95%) ✅
- Critical paths: 100% ✅

Uncovered lines:
- app/services/example.py:45 - Error handling for rare DB failure (acceptable)
```

**Document issues:**
```markdown
### Console Check: ⚠️ Issues Found
- [ ] Issue: 404 for /static/css/missing.css (needs fix)
- [x] No JavaScript errors
- [x] No HTMX errors
```
